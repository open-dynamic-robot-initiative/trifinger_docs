      TriFingerEdu


The TriFinger robots have been developed and built at the `Max Planck Institute for
Intelligent Systems`_ (MPI-IS) in TÃ¼bingen, Germany.
There are currently eight **TriFingerPro** robots hosted at MPI-IS which can be accessed
remotely and were used for the `Real Robot Challenge`_.

The **TriFingerEdu** is an open-source version of the challenge robot, with identical
actuators, almost identical kinematics, and identical software.
Compared to the challenge platform, the "Edu"-version is easier to construct, such that
researchers are able to build it themselves.


About this Documentation
========================

Documentation of the usage of the TriFinger robots and of the various software packages
that are involved is a bit distributed over several places.  The documentation you are
currently reading serves as a main entry point that covers the overarching aspects and
points to more specific documentations (e.g. of individual packages) where appropriate.
